    <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold"> co-founder of Versara, social justice advocate, and relentless creative.</p>
        <p> Jiyoo is a rising second year student at the
        University of California - Berkeley studying
        Computer Science and Statistics. She is deeply
        passionate about the intersectionalities of
        seemingly diverse fields like art, science,
        business and social justice. With deep roots
        in art, she hopes to continue with her creative
        passions into the future, engineering solutions
        to the world's wicked problems. </p>
    <p>Currently, she is working as a Campus Ambassador
        for the university as well as the Program Assistant for
        the American Cultures Center. Jiyoo has interned for
        startups in the Berkeley Skydeck Cohort program, serving as a
        campus manager for CatalystX and a business development intern
        at Artivive. In the summer of 2019, Jiyoo is broadening her
        scope of experiences by delving into nanotechnology research
        as an undergraduate assistant and creating a new company, Versara,
        along side her three co-founders. </p>

        <p> Jiyoo spends her evenings working on projects and artworks. Her
        focus is on the essence of light and reflection. She is also learning how to create websites and mobile apps. In her free time, Jiyoo likes to visit the local thrift stores of
        Berkeley to find hidden gems others have donated. She also enjoys picnicking
        on the school glades and listening to podcasts on the future of design,
        technology and society. </p>
