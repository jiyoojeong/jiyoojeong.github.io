                <li><strong>Special Relativity Essay</strong><i>- International Baccalaureate</i>
                    <br><br>Abstract:
                <p class="soft-research">Time is but a construct that has evolved with civilization:
                    an indefinite and infinite material that man has decided to subdivide into hours,
                    minutes, and seconds. For the longest time, we believed that time was inflexible.
                    Jumping back and forth in time could only be done through the efforts of fictional
                    narrators and sentimental mementos -- or can time be warped even in real life?
                    Einstein in 1905 postulated relativistic time dilation: a phenomenon where time
                    runs slowly when considering special relativity and general relativity based on
                    Einstein’s two theories on relativity. This paper will further explore the validity
                    of Einstein’s time dilation with the question “To what extent is Einstein’s time
                    dilation postulate valid?”</p></li>

                <li><strong> Orbital Optimization of Near-Earth Asterioids</strong> <i>- Yale University Astronomy</i>
                <br><br>Abstract:
                    <p class="soft-research">Near-Earth asteroids are one of the most-immediate threats to the Earth and humanity. Asteroids like
                        the Chelyabinsk meteor that exploded over Russia in 2013 have caused significant damages in the area, while others like the
                        Chicxulub asteroid that impacted the Earth 66 million years ago have altered the course of natural history.
                        Asteroids such as 1998 YP11 have elliptical orbits that bring them close to the orbit of the Earth, making them potential impactors.
                        We have taken a month of images of 1998 YP11 and modelled the asteroid's long term orbit using the Method of Gauss, a Runge-Kutta-4
                        integrator, a genetic algorithm optimizer, and a long-term integrator. We have calculated the celestial orbital elements
                        eccentricity vector of a = 2.5275 au, e = 0.56530, i = 14.861°, Omega = 55.858°, and omega = 170.71°.
                        Albedo and absolute magnitude were also measured in order to estimate the asteroid's size. Within the next 160,000 years,
                        1998 YP11's distance of closest approach is 0.0077430 AU, which will be in 48499 years. Though dangerously close, it will
                        be at a distance four times the distance of the Moon to the Earth. </p></li>
